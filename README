Android Basic Walkie Talkie 

This work was initiated at Mil-OSS 2011 in support of Major James Neushul's 
objectives to improve both position location information (PLI) and radio 
communications in the field using consumer technology. The basic idea is 
to get handheld devices in the hands of individual Marines that can 
supplement the existing communications tools that may not be as easy 
to put in everyone's hands.

In a tactical situation, it is valuable to track three data points
about the location of peers:

 * Location on the network
 * Physical location on the planet
 * Location in your organization

It would be great if people could talk to each other over a 'Walkie Talkie'
service using Android phones in a peer to peer manner consistent with
tactical radios. Some of the characteristics of this include the ability
to operate on an isolated network, emulating tactical radio networks
in order to leverage current tactics, techniques and procedures for
radio communications in the field.

Some of the basic features desired are:

 * Discover nearby peers
 * Encourage ad-hoc communication
 * Achieve IP voice communication, either point to point or broadcast
 * Hands-free operation on smart phones
 * Voice recognition in support of existing radio protocols
   * Radio Check
   * Authenticate
   * Identification
 * Network creation, management, and control

This has been created as a community project in the hopes that it will 
be broadly useful.  This has the potential to be used for tactical military
communications.  However, it has been initiated in the public realm so
that it could also be used in more widespread applications. Some examples
of these uses are things like gaming (paintball, geocaching), personal 
radio services, or finding your family or friends in a large crowd. 

We hope to leverge a larger community to develop software than is typically
involved in military projects. The broad, community-based collaborative
development model has lead to growing successes in many innovative projects.
